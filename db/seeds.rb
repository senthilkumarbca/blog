# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# 20.times do |i|
#   Post.create(title: "post #{i+1}",content:"this is the post and it is the #{i+1}th post",topic_id:"#{rand(10..13)}")
# end
